# üîòDeploying The Auto-scallingüîò


## ‚ö™introduction
### Target Group
A *Target Group* is a logical grouping of resources (like EC2 instances or containers) that receive incoming traffic from a load balancer.  
- You register servers (targets) such as EC2 instances or IP addresses.  
- The load balancer routes requests to these targets based on health checks and routing rules.  
- Targets can be added or removed without affecting the load balancer configuration.

### Auto Scaling Group (ASG)
An *Auto Scaling Group* automatically adjusts the number of compute resources to handle changes in traffic.  
- It launches or terminates EC2 instances based on defined scaling policies.  
- Ensures the desired number of instances is always running (high availability).  
- Helps optimize costs by scaling down during low demand and scaling up when traffic increases.

### Load Balancer
A *Load Balancer* distributes incoming network traffic across multiple targets to improve availability and reliability of your application.  
- It prevents any single server from becoming a point of failure.  
- Types in AWS include *Application Load Balancer (ALB), **Network Load Balancer (NLB), and **Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB)*.  
- Works seamlessly with Target Groups and Auto Scaling Groups for dynamic, fault-tolerant architectures.


step 1. Launch this 3 template

##üìù Summary
- **Target Group** ‚Üí Defines where the traffic should go (set of targets).  
- **Load Balancer** ‚Üí Distributes traffic across targets in a target group.  
- **Auto Scaling Group** ‚Üí Manages scaling of EC2 instances to match demand.  

Together, they provide a **scalable, reliable, and fault-tolerant architecture** for modern cloud applications.
